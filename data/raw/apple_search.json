"description":"iWant is essentially the combination of 3 location based apps : Restaurant reviews (Yelp, UrbanSpoon), Movie showtimes (Flixter, Fandango) and Yellow Pages (Yellow Pages, AroundMe).  Why use iWant instead of these separate ones ? \n\n\u2022 iWant is faster, simpler and presents all this varied information in a clean and unified view.  It will help you reduce clutter on your home screen as it combines the functionality of several other apps.\n\n\u2022 Unlike typical Yellow Pages apps like AroundMe, iWant gives you restaurant reviews (instead of just a list of names) and movie times (rather than just a list of theaters near you) so that you can make an informed decision.\n\n\u2022 iWant has 3 pages of category icons, giving you one-tap access to over 30 categories.  Also, you can filter restaurants and nightlife with another two taps -- no typing required.\n\n\u2022 iWant can also show you nearby landmarks from Wikipedia (try the 'W' icon on the second page) so that you can use iWant like a virtual tour guide in a new city.\n\n\u2022 Use the settings icon (bottom left) to narrow or expand the search radius.  Use the map icon (bottom right) to see your results plotted on an interactive map.\n\nAs seen in : The Wall St. Journal (Walt Mossberg and Katherine Boehret), The NYTimes (Michelle Higgins) and WIRED magazine (Mathew Honan).\n\nPlease watch the instructional videos @ http://vimeo.com/iwant\n\nIf prefer not to see any ads, please consider purchasing iWant Pro.", "currency":"USD", "genres":["Navigation", "Lifestyle"], "genreIds":["6010", "6012"], "releaseDate":"2008-07-17T12:07:19Z", "sellerName":"Rudrajit Samanta", "bundleId":"com.rudro.iwant", "trackId":284945674, "trackName":"iWant", "primaryGenreName":"Navigation", "primaryGenreId":6010, "releaseNotes":"- Fixed issue where you could not update the location\n- Fix for movie times\n- Fix for bad settings causing it to crash on launch", "formattedPrice":"Free", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"iWant", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iwant/id284945674?mt=8&uo=4", "contentAdvisoryRating":"4+", "artworkUrl100":"http://a1385.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/0f/a5/61/mzl.erxeldoy.tiff", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"4623460", "sellerUrl":"http://hotnewspots.com/iWant", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":3.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":22, "trackContentRating":"4+", "averageUserRating":2.5, "userRatingCount":19154},

"description":"Your iPhone can now feed you. No, your phone hasn\u2019t learned to cook but you won\u2019t have to either, thanksto the free, easy-to-use Eat24 Order Food Delivery & Takeout app.\n\nOrder food delivery from over 25,000 restaurants in 1,000+ cities, with more being added each day. Search from wherever you are, or wherever you\u2019re going to be when you\u2019re ready for some food. The Eat24 app remembers your preferences, which saves you time, and gives you coupons on a regular basis, which saves you money.\n\nWhat can our app do?\n\n- Search for specific cuisines, restaurants...even particular dishes.\n\n- It has Yelp inside. See what the foodies of Yelp think about a restaurant without leaving the app.\n\n- Eye Candy. Eat with your eyes and browse delicious food photos on the restaurant menu page. As if you weren\u2019t hungry enough already.\n\n- In unfamiliar territory? Search by your current location, order, and the Eat24 app will have it waiting (well, really the restaurant will, but you get the idea).\n\n- Like to play favorites? We understand completely (Mom always liked us best). The Eat24 app lets you save your favorite restaurants so you can find them more easily next time.\n\n- Do you enjoy entering your credit card numbers over and over again? That\u2019s a rhetorical question, no one does. Which is why the Eat24 app lets you scan your credit card directly into the app and securely stores your payment information for you.\n\n- Hate credit cards? Use PayPal!\n\n- 24 Hour Live chat and order status support. If it isn\u2019t right, we\u2019ll make it right. No robots, no problem.\n\n- Cash back for future orders through our CashCoupon rewards system.\n\n- Exclusive offers and content through our Eat24Hours VIP program.\n\n- Take pictures of your food and capture the memory of your meal before you devour it. Because a picture is worth 1,000 yums, and because they make other people jealous and hungry. (And really, isn\u2019t that the point of taking food photos?)\n\n- Eat24 Notes. Write a note about your meal right on your phone and remind yourself to order/not order an item again. (Because hunger affects memory in mysterious ways)\n\n- The My Menu feature lets you assemble an All-Star team of your favorite past-ordered items from a restaurant for easy re-ordering. And less thinking than ever before.\n\n- We added the popular Tweet My Meal function, because everyone knows that if you didn\u2019t tweet about it, it didn\u2019t actually happen.\n\nBest of all, once your order\u2019s in, Eat24 handles every aspect of the delivery experience. Which means no more screwed-up orders. No more wondering where the delivery driver is. Just the ability to take back a few precious minutes of your day and enjoy. Something not quite right? Hit up our 24 Hours Live Support within the app and chat with a real human being about any issue or question you may have. We\u2019ll make things right.\n\nTap, Relax and Enjoy with the Eat24 app.", "currency":"USD", "genres":["Food & Drink", "Travel"], "genreIds":["6023", "6003"], "releaseDate":"2012-05-24T08:45:58Z", "sellerName":"Eat24Hours.com Inc", "bundleId":"com.eat24.eat24App", "trackId":517729226, "trackName":"Eat24 Order Food Delivery & Takeout", "primaryGenreName":"Food & Drink", "primaryGenreId":6023,

No. No it does not.\n\nWill it let you start a chat even if you\u2019re too hungry to remember your own email address? Yes.

Display the direction or route to your destination and simply hold up the iPhone to intuitively read the map. Perform a transfer search to your destination, and perform another route search from your exit station. \n \nIn addition, you can share your current location and destination by email with another AR Map user, which is handy for setting up a meeting spot at a first-time location or during travel. \n\nYou can set the destination from an address or station name in Google Local  Search. Of course you can also search for places like a public restroom or movie theater. \n\nRecommended devices: iPhone4S、iPhone5  \n\u203bThe iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 are not recommended devices. \n\n【Main features of AR Map】 \n・After specifying a destination, by simply holding up the iPhone the app shows you the direction to your destination! \n・AR tags show the direction so you can navigate to your destination! \n・Search for information on nearby cafes and restaurants! \n・Easily send your current location or destination to friends by email!\n・Navigate the route to your friend\u2019s current location! \n・Find information on nearby shops and hotels through a site like Hot Pepper or Jalan and set it as your destination! \n・Confirm transfer instructions for public transportation on Google Transfer! \n・Map can be selected from the standard app or Google Maps!\n【Using AR Map smartly】 \nSave battery life by normally using map mode and temporarily switching to AR mode as needed.

"description":"iWant is essentially the combination of 3 location based apps : Restaurant reviews (Yelp, UrbanSpoon), Movie showtimes (Flixter, Fandango) and Yellow Pages (Yellow Pages, AroundMe).  Why use iWant Pro instead of these separate ones ? \n\n\u2022 iWant Pro is faster, simpler and presents all this varied information in a clean and unified view.  It will help you reduce clutter on your home screen as it combines the functionality of several other apps.\n\n\u2022 Unlike typical Yellow Pages apps like AroundMe, iWant Pro gives you restaurant reviews (instead of just a list of names) and movie times (rather than just a list of theaters near you) so that you can make an informed decision.\n\n\u2022 iWant Pro has 3 pages of category icons, giving you one-tap access to over 30 categories.  Also, you can filter restaurants and nightlife with another two taps -- no typing required.\n\n\u2022 iWant Pro can also show you nearby landmarks from Wikipedia (try the 'W' icon on the second page) so that you can use iWant Pro like a virtual tour guide in a new city.\n\n\u2022 Use the settings icon (bottom left) to narrow or expand the search radius.  Use the map icon (bottom right) to see your results plotted on an interactive map.\n\nAs seen in : The Wall St. Journal (Walt Mossberg and Katherine Boehret), The NYTimes (Michelle Higgins) and WIRED magazine (Mathew Honan).\n\nPlease watch the instructional videos @ http://vimeo.com/iwant\n\nIf you'd like to try before you buy, you can download iWant for free (it's ad supported).", "currency":"USD", "genres":["Navigation", "Travel"], "genreIds":["6010", "6003"], "releaseDate":"2009-05-21T02:04:12Z", "sellerName":"Rudrajit Samanta", "bundleId":"com.rudro.iwantpro", "trackId":313008539, "trackName":"iWant Pro", "primaryGenreName":"Navigation", "primaryGenreId":6010, "releaseNotes":"- Fixed issue where you could not update the location\n- Fix for movie times\n- Fix for bad settings causing it to crash on launch", "formattedPrice":"$0.99", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"iWant Pro", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iwant-pro/id313008539?mt=8&uo=4", "contentAdvisoryRating":"4+", "artworkUrl100":"http://a1512.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/aa/f3/f8/mzl.hesqihbm.tiff", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"4624768", "sellerUrl":"http://hotnewspots.com/iWant", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":3.0, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":3, "trackContentRating":"4+", "averageUserRating":3.0, "userRatingCount":285},
